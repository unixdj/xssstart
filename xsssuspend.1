.Sh NAME
.Nm xsssuspend
.Nd suspend X screen saver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar command Op Ar argument ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
suspends the X screen saver and DPMS timer for the duration of its runtime.
After it
terminates for any reason or is disconnected from the X server,
the timers are restarted, unless suspended by another client.
.Pp
.Nm
shuts down the X server connection and exits with status 0
if it receives the
.Dv SIGTERM
(termination) signal.
If no command is given,
.Dv SIGINT
(keyboard interrupt, normally
.Li Control-C )
is handled in the same manner.
.Pp
If a command is given,
.Nm
runs the command and exits after it's finished,
or immediately if execution fails.
.Dv SIGINT
is ignored in this mode, delegating its handling to the child process.
.Pp
If initialisation fails,
.Nm
exits immediately.
It wakes up once per hour to check its connection to the X server,
and exits on any X error.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width indent
