XSSSUSPEND(1)                    Local Manual                    XSSSUSPEND(1)

NAME
     xsssuspend — suspend X screen saver

SYNOPSIS
     xsssuspend [command [argument ...]]

DESCRIPTION
     xsssuspend suspends the X screen saver and DPMS timer for the duration of
     its runtime.  After xsssuspend terminates for any reason or is discon‐
     nected from the X server, the timers are restarted, unless suspended by
     another client.

     If no command is given, xsssuspend will wait indefinitely until it's ter‐
     minated by a signal.  It's meant to be killed by a keyboard interrupt
     (normally Control-C).

     If a command is given, xsssuspend runs the command and exits after it's
     finished, or immediately if execution fails.

EXAMPLES
     xsssuspend telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl
             Watch Star Wars in the terminal, suspending the screen saver for
             the duration of the film.

DIAGNOSTICS
     xsssuspend exits 0 on success, 127 if exec(3) fails and 1 if another er‐
     ror occurs.

     Being killed by SIGINT (keyboard interrupt) or SIGTERM (termination) sig‐
     nal is not considered an error.  Exit status of the command is not propa‐
     gated.
