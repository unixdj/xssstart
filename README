NAME
     xssstart — run a command when X screen saver activates

SYNOPSIS
     xssstart command [argument ...]

     xssstart runs the specified command on XScreenSaver(3) ScreenSaverOn
     events.  As long as the command is running, further events are ignored.

EXAMPLES
     xssstart xlock -mode blank &
             Starts xssstart in the background, running xlock(1) in blank mode
             when the screen saver activates.

     xset s 600
             Sets the screen saver parameters to activate after 600 seconds of
             inactivity.

     xset s activate
             Activates the screen saver immediately.

XSSSUSPEND(1)                    Local Manual                    XSSSUSPEND(1)

NAME
     xsssuspend — suspend X screen saver

SYNOPSIS
     xsssuspend [command [argument ...]]

DESCRIPTION
     xsssuspend suspends the X screen saver and DPMS timer for the duration of
     its runtime.  After it terminates for any reason or is disconnected from
     the X server, the timers are restarted, unless suspended by another
     client.

     xsssuspend shuts down the X server connection and exits with status 0 if
     it receives the SIGTERM (termination) signal.  If no command is given,
     SIGINT (keyboard interrupt, normally Control-C) is handled in the same
     manner.

     If a command is given, xsssuspend runs the command and exits after it's
     finished, or immediately if execution fails.  SIGINT is ignored in this
     mode, delegating its handling to the child process.

     If initialisation fails, xsssuspend exits immediately.  It wakes up once
     per hour to check its connection to the X server, and exits on any X er‐
     ror.

EXAMPLES
     xsssuspend telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl
             Watch Star Wars in the terminal, suspending the screen saver for
             the duration of the film.

DIAGNOSTICS
     xsssuspend exits 0 if killed by SIGINT or SIGTERM, 126 if exec(3) fails
     and 127 if another error occurs.  If the child process exits, xsssuspend
     propagates its exit status.  If the child process is terminated by a sig‐
     nal, xsssuspend exits 128 plus the signal number.
